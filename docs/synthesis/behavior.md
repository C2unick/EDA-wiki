### High-level Synthesis
 - [LegUp](http://legup.eecg.utoronto.ca/) (Toronto)
   - *A **high-level synthesis** tool to improve C to Verilog synthesis without building an infrastructure from scratch.*
 - [GAUT](http://www.gaut.fr/) (Universit√© Bretagne Sud)
   - *A high-level synthesis tool from algorithm to hardware architecture.*
 - [PandA](https://panda.dei.polimi.it/) (Politecnico di Milano)
   - *A usable framework that will enable the research of new ideas in the HW-SW Co-Design field.*
 - [FCUDA](https://github.com/adsc-hls/fcuda) (ADSC High Level Synthesis Team)
   - *A source-to-source transformation framework that takes CUDA kernels with FCUDA annotation pragmas as input and produces a synthesizable C code.*
