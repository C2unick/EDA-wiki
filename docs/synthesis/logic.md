### Logic Synthesis
 - [ABC](https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc) (Berkeley)
   - A sequential logic synthesis and formal verification tool.
 - [ALSO](https://github.com/nbulsi/also) (Ningbo Univ.)
   - Based on the [EPFL Logic Synthesis Libraries](https://github.com/lsils/lstools-showcase); aim to exploit advanced logic synthesis tools for both modern FPGA and emerging nanotechnologies.
 - [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) (Clifford Wolf)
   - A framework for Verilog RTL synthesis, used by qflow and OpenROAD.
 - [CirKit](https://github.com/msoeken/cirkit) (EPFL)
   - CirKit is a logic synthesis and optimization framework. It is implemented based on various [EPFL Logic Synthesis Libraries](https://github.com/lsils/lstools-showcase). [RevKit 3.1](https://github.com/msoeken/revkit) (for reversible logic synthesis) is a Python library without a stand-alone interface as in CirKit. 
 - [mockturtle](https://github.com/lsils/mockturtle)
   - A logic network library providing several logic network implementations.
 - [percy](https://github.com/whaaswijk/percy)
   - A header-only exact synthesis library offering a collection of different synthesizers and exact synthesis methods.
