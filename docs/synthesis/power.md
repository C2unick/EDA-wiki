### Power Network Synthesis
- OpenROAD [OpeNPDN](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpeNPDN)
  - Machine learning-based on-chip power delivery network (PDN) synthesis at the placement stage.
- OpenROAD [pdn](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/tree/master/src/pdngen)
  - This utility aims to simplify the process of adding a power grid into a floorplan. 

### Power Network Analysis
- OpenROAD [PDNSim](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/PDNSim)
  - Input: placed and synthesized PDN
  - Output: static IR drop report, worst case IR drop; static IR drop plots
