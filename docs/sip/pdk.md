### Process Design Kit (PDK) and Physical IPs
 - [DesignStart Physical IP](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/designstart/physical-ip) (ARM)
   - The most comprehensive physical IP with no upfront fees – for companies to produce commercial silicon or for universities to research
 - [SkyWater Open Source PDK](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk) (Google, SkyWater)
   - The SkyWater Open Source PDK is a collaboration between Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source Process Design Kit and related resources, which can be used to create manufacturable designs at SkyWater’s facility.
 - [FreePDK](https://www.eda.ncsu.edu/wiki/FreePDK) (NC State)
   - An open-source, Open-Access-based PDK for the 45nm technology node and the Predictive Technology Model.
 - [Open-Cell](http://www.si2.org/open-cell-library/) (Si2)
   - Silvaco's 15nm Open-Cell Library
   - No charge for universities and Si2 members

### PDK for CNTFET
- Variation-Aware [Nanosystem Design Kit (NDK)](https://nanohub.org/resources/22582) (Stanford)
  - A framework that quickly evaluates the impact of CNT variations on circuit delay and noise margin, and systematically explores the large space of CNT processing options to derive optimized CNT processing and CNFET circuit design guidelines.

### PDK for Silicon Photonics
- [SiEPIC EBeam PDK](https://github.com/SiEPIC/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK) (UBC), under [MIT License](https://github.com/SiEPIC/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
  - For silicon photonics layout, design, verification and circuit simulation.
