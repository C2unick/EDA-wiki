   - A high-performance and robust software package for solving large-scale sparse linear systems of equations (Ax = b) on multi-core shared-memory machines.
 - [mixedsim](https://github.com/Isotel/mixedsim) (Isotel)
   - Mixed signal simulation with Verilog.
 - [Gnucap: GNU Circuit Analysis Package](http://gnucap.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=gnucap:start)
   - A modern "post-spice" analog and mixed signal circuit simulator.
 - [Qucs: Quite Universal Circuit Simulator](https://github.com/Qucs/qucs/)
   - Setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit.
 - [Xyce](https://xyce.sandia.gov/) (Sandia NL)
   - An open source, SPICE-compatible, high-performance analog circuit simulator, capable of solving extremely large circuit problems by supporting large-scale parallel computing platforms.
